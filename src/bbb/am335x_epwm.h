 * This module is based on the software library developped by Texas Instruments
 * Incorporated - http://www.ti.com/ for its AM335x starter kit.
 *
 * Project: HEIA-FRÂ / Embedded Systems 1 Laboratory
 *
 * Abstract: AM335x PWMSS - ePWM1/2
 *
 * Purpose: This module implements basic services to drive the AM335x
 *          Enhanced Pulse-Width Modulation module 1 and 2 (ePWM1 /eWPM2).
